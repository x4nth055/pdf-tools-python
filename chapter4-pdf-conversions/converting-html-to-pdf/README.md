To get started, install PDFKit with pip:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, make sure to install [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) on your system. You can follow the instructions there or on our book.

After that, edit the code in `convert_html_to_pdf.py` to your liking. You can change the HTML file, the CSS file, and the output PDF file. Then, run the script:
```bash
$ python convert_html_to_pdf.py
```
