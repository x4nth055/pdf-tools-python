# The Zen of Python

The Zen of Python is a set of guiding principles for Python's design. It consists of 20 aphorisms that summarize the philosophy behind Python's development. Some of the key principles include:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

# Python Basics

## Math Operators

Math operators in Python have different precedence levels. The highest precedence is given to the exponent operator (**), followed by modulus/remainder (%), integer division (//), division (/), multiplication (*), subtraction (-), and addition (+).

## Data Types

Python supports different data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. Integers are whole numbers, floating-point numbers are decimal numbers, and strings are sequences of characters.

## Variables

In Python, variables are used to store values. They can be named anything as long as they follow certain rules, such as starting with a letter or underscore and consisting of letters, numbers, and underscores.

## Comments

Comments are used to add explanatory notes to code. In Python, inline comments start with a hash symbol (#), and multiline comments can be enclosed in triple quotes (''' ''').

## The print() Function

The print() function is used to display output in Python. It can be used to print strings, variables, and formatted text.

## The input() Function

The input() function is used to get user input in Python. It displays a prompt and waits for the user to enter a value.

## The len() Function

The len() function returns the length of a string or the number of elements in a list, dictionary, or other iterable object.

## The str(), int(), and float() Functions

The str(), int(), and float() functions are used to convert values between different data types. str() converts a value to a string, int() converts a value to an integer, and float() converts a value to a floating-point number.

# Flow Control

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values in Python. They include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), and greater than or equal to (>=).

## Boolean Evaluation

Boolean evaluation in Python involves using the is and is not operators to compare values. It is recommended to use these operators instead of == and != for boolean operations.

## Boolean Operators

Boolean operators in Python include and, or, and not. They are used to combine boolean expressions and evaluate them.

## if Statements

if statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions. They allow for conditional execution of code blocks.

## else Statements

else statements are used in conjunction with if statements to execute code when the condition in the if statement is not met.

## elif Statements

elif statements are used to check multiple conditions in a series of if statements. They are used when there are more than two possible outcomes.

## while Loop Statements

while loop statements are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

## break Statements

break statements are used to exit a loop prematurely. They are often used in conjunction with if statements to check for a specific condition and break out of the loop if it is met.

## continue Statements

continue statements are used to skip the rest of the code in a loop and move on to the next iteration.

## for Loops and the range() Function

for loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements. The range() function is often used to generate a sequence of numbers to iterate over.

## For else statement

The for else statement allows for specifying a statement to execute if the full loop has been executed. It is useful when a break condition can occur in the loop.

## Importing Modules

Modules in Python are used to organize code into separate files. They can be imported into other Python scripts to use their functions and variables.

## Ending a Program Early with sys.exit()
