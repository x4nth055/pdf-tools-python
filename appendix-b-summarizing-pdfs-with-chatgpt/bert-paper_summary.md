# BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding

## Abstract
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a new language representation model that pretrains deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. Unlike previous models, BERT conditions on both left and right context in all layers, allowing for fine-tuning with just one additional output layer. BERT achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing tasks, including question answering and language inference.

## Introduction
Language model pre-training has been effective for improving natural language processing tasks. There are two strategies for applying pre-trained language representations: feature-based and fine-tuning. BERT improves fine-tuning approaches by using a masked language model (MLM) pre-training objective, which allows for deep bidirectional representations. BERT reduces the need for task-specific architectures and achieves state-of-the-art performance on sentence-level and token-level tasks.

## Related Work
Previous approaches to pre-training language representations include unsupervised feature-based approaches and unsupervised fine-tuning approaches. Feature-based approaches use pre-trained representations as additional features, while fine-tuning approaches pre-train sentence or document encoders and fine-tune them for downstream tasks. BERT improves upon these approaches by using a masked language model pre-training objective and achieving state-of-the-art results on sentence-level tasks.

## Conclusion
BERT introduces a new language representation model that pretrains deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. It achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing tasks and reduces the need for task-specific architectures. BERT is a powerful and effective approach for language understanding.
